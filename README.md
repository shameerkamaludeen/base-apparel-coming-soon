## Overview

The challenge helped me familiarize some javascript, CSS grid and flex also client-side form validation and Constraint Validation API. As these are the things used to make the solution for the challenge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
